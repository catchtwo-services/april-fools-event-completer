### Setup

As usual, you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) v21 or newer installed, you can install the required packages through ``npm i`` or on online pterodactyl hosts by uploading the package.json to the container directory.

All you need to configure is the tokens you wish to run it, you can enter them in [./tokens.txt](tokens.txt), in the format already displayed in the file:
```
TOKEN1
TOKEN2
TOKEN3
```
You are not required to use multiple tokens, nor are you limited to 3, if you want to, you can remove the other ones or add as much as you'd like.

#### Startup
You can start it with ``node index.js``.
